# Adaptive-Thresholding
This repository includes the implementation of adaptive thresholding in Python. The implementation is from scratch and the adaptive_threshold method is the same as the original one is. Same arguments needs to be passed in order to get the better results. Moreover adaptiveMethod which includes **ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C** and **ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C**.

### Prerequisites
There are only two requirements which needs to be fullfilled before runnning the pythin script.
* Python needs to be installed. Script works for all python versions but latest version is appreciated. 
* OpenCV should be installed in System. **Only image reading and showing method is being used from the OpenCV. Rest of the implementation is from scratch**

### Results
* Following image has been used for testing the performance of adaptive_threshold.

* Below image is the output of initial image.

**Fee free to give comment about this method and please let me know how can I improve**
